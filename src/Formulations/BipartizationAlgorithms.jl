    BipartizationAlgorithms.jl

Bipartition algorithms used to convert a multiblock graph into a bipartite graph.

This module provides various algorithms for transforming general multiblock graphs into bipartite graphs,
which is essential for certain decomposition algorithms like ADMM that require bipartite structure.

# Overview
Each algorithm takes a multiblock graph and a multiblock problem as input, and produces two key outputs:

1. **Node Assignment**: Maps each node to its assigned partition (0 or 1)
   - 0 = left partition
   - 1 = right partition

2. **Edge Splitting**: Maps each edge to splitting decisions (a, b) where:
   - a = 0: the edge is not split (kept as original edge)
   - a = 1: the edge is split into two edges (i, k) and (k, j) with intermediate node k
   - b = 0: the split edge/node is assigned to the left partition
   - b = 1: the split edge/node is assigned to the right partition

# Algorithms Available
- **MILP**: Mixed Integer Linear Programming approach (optimal but slower)
- **BFS**: Breadth-First Search traversal (fast heuristic)
- **DFS**: Depth-First Search traversal (fast heuristic)
- **Spanning Tree**: Spanning tree with smart back edge processing (balanced approach)

# Usage
These algorithms are typically used as preprocessing steps for decomposition algorithms
that require bipartite graph structure, such as ADMM-based solvers.

# Mathematical Background
A bipartite graph has the property that all nodes can be colored with two colors such that
no two adjacent nodes have the same color. For general graphs, this may require:
- Splitting edges (inserting intermediate nodes)
- Carefully assigning nodes to partitions

The choice of algorithm depends on the trade-off between solution quality and computational speed.

Bipartization algorithm using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP).

This algorithm formulates the graph bipartization problem as an optimization problem that 
finds the optimal bipartite structure while minimizing operator norms and graph complexity.

# Arguments
- `graph::MultiblockGraph`: The graph to bipartize
- `mbp::MultiblockProblem`: The original multiblock problem (used for operator norm calculations)
- `nodesAssignment::Dict{String, Int64}`: Dictionary to store node partition assignments (0 for left, 1 for right)
- `edgesSplitting::Dict{String, Tuple{Int64, Int64}}`: Dictionary to store edge splitting decisions (a,b) where:
  - a = 0: edge not split, a = 1: edge split
  - b = 0: assigned to left partition, b = 1: assigned to right partition

# Algorithm Steps
1. **Variable Creation**: Binary variables for node assignments and edge splitting decisions
2. **Constraint Formulation**: Ensures each node belongs to exactly one partition
3. **Bipartite Constraints**: Prevents adjacent nodes from being in the same partition (or splits the edge)
4. **Objective Optimization**: Minimizes operator norms and graph complexity
5. **Solution Extraction**: Converts optimal solution to node assignments and edge splitting decisions

# Mathematical Formulation
- **Variables**: `x_node_L[i]`, `x_node_R[i]` (node assignments), `z_edge[e]` (edge splitting), `x_edge_L[e]`, `x_edge_R[e]` (edge assignments)
- **Constraints**: Partition constraints, bipartite constraints, edge splitting logic
- **Objective**: `min t_L + t_R + complexity_terms` where `t_L`, `t_R` are operator norm bounds

# Advantages
- **Optimal Solution**: Finds the best bipartization according to the objective function
- **Operator Norm Awareness**: Considers the numerical properties of the original problem
- **Principled Approach**: Mathematical optimization rather than heuristic

# Disadvantages
- **Computational Cost**: Slower than heuristic methods, especially for large graphs
- **Solver Dependency**: Requires HiGHS or another MILP solver
- **Memory Usage**: May require significant memory for large problems

# Usage
This algorithm is recommended when solution quality is more important than computational speed,
particularly for problems where operator norm considerations are critical for numerical stability.

# Implementation Notes
- Uses HiGHS solver with silent mode enabled
- Automatically handles both TWO_BLOCK_EDGE and MULTIBLOCK_EDGE types
- Operator norms are computed using the `operatorNorm2` function from the mappings
- The dictionaries `nodesAssignment` and `edgesSplitting` are cleared and populated by the algorithm

by splitting edges when conflicts are detected.

- `graph::MultiblockGraph`: The graph to bipartize
- `mbp::MultiblockProblem`: The original multiblock problem (not used in algorithm, included for interface consistency)

  - a = 0: edge not split, a = 1: edge split
  - b = 0: assigned to left partition, b = 1: assigned to right partition

# Algorithm Steps
1. **Neighbor Construction**: Build adjacency list from graph edges
2. **Connected Components**: Process each connected component separately
3. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from unvisited nodes, perform BFS with alternating partition assignment
4. **Conflict Detection**: When adjacent nodes would have the same partition, split the connecting edge
5. **Edge Processing**: Set splitting decisions for all edges (split or keep)

# BFS Process
- **Queue-Based**: Uses FIFO queue for breadth-first traversal
- **Alternating Assignment**: Assigns nodes to alternating partitions (0, 1, 0, 1, ...)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Splits edges when both endpoints would be in the same partition
- **Component Handling**: Alternates starting partition for different connected components

# Advantages
- **Fast Execution**: O(V + E) time complexity where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward algorithm with predictable behavior
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory overhead beyond input graph
- **Handles Disconnected Graphs**: Automatically processes all connected components

# Disadvantages
- **Suboptimal Results**: May split more edges than necessary
- **No Operator Norm Consideration**: Ignores numerical properties of the original problem
- **Traversal Order Dependence**: Results may depend on node iteration order

# Usage
This algorithm is recommended when:
- Fast execution is more important than optimal results
- The graph is large and MILP would be too slow

3. **Edge Classification**: Classify edges as tree edges or back edges
4. **Smart Back Edge Processing**: Only split back edges if endpoints have the same color
5. **Edge Decision Assignment**: Set splitting decisions for all edges

# Mathematical Foundation
- **Spanning Tree Property**: Any tree is bipartite and can be 2-colored
- **Back Edge Analysis**: A back edge preserves bipartiteness if its endpoints have different colors
- **Optimal Splitting**: Only splits edges that would violate bipartiteness

# Algorithm Process
- **Tree Edges**: Always kept intact (never split) since they maintain bipartite structure
- **Back Edges with Different Colors**: Kept intact (already valid for bipartite graph)
- **Back Edges with Same Color**: Split to avoid violating bipartiteness
- **Connected Components**: Each component processed independently

# Advantages
- **Balanced Approach**: Good compromise between speed and solution quality
- **Minimal Splitting**: Splits only edges that truly violate bipartiteness
- **Deterministic**: Always produces the same result for the same graph
- **Handles Disconnected Graphs**: Automatically processes all connected components
- **Mathematically Sound**: Based on solid graph theory principles

# Disadvantages
- **No Operator Norm Consideration**: Ignores numerical properties of the original problem
- **Spanning Tree Dependence**: Results may depend on which spanning tree is chosen
- **Not Globally Optimal**: May not find the absolute minimum number of splits

# Comparison with Other Algorithms
- **vs MILP**: Faster but may not be globally optimal
- **vs BFS/DFS**: Usually produces fewer edge splits due to intelligent edge processing
- **vs Naive Spanning Tree**: Much more efficient (doesn't split all back edges)

# Usage
This algorithm is recommended when:
- You want a balance between solution quality and computational speed
- The graph has many cycles (where back edge processing provides benefits)
- You prefer a deterministic algorithm over heuristics
- Operator norm considerations are not critical

# Implementation Notes
- Uses DFS to build spanning tree for each connected component
- Maintains separate sets for visited nodes and tree edges
- 2-colors the spanning tree using BFS
- All back edges are analyzed for potential splitting
- The dictionaries `nodesAssignment` and `edgesSplitting` are cleared and populated by the algorithm

# Time Complexity
- **Spanning Tree Construction**: O(V + E)
- **Tree Coloring**: O(V + E)
- **Back Edge Processing**: O(E)
- **Overall**: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
